# GPT-CopyPaster

A lightweight, efficient tool for selecting, copying, and exporting messages from ChatGPT conversations. This userscript enhances the ChatGPT interface with a non-intrusive utility that lets you save important responses for later use.

## Features

- **Message Selection**: Click on any message to select/deselect it
- **Batch Operations**: Select multiple messages at once
- **Copy Formatting**: Preserves formatting, code blocks, and structure when copying
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Save as Markdown, HTML, or plain text
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use Ctrl+C/Cmd+C to copy selected messages
- **Unobtrusive Design**: Clean UI that integrates with ChatGPT's aesthetic

## What's New in v1.2.3

This maintenance update fixes two important user experience issues:

1. **Toast Notification Fix**: Notification messages now appear consistently when copying content via keyboard shortcuts, even if the control panel isn't open
